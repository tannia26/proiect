            <h6>OUR STORY</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="about-us-text">
            <p>     Danielle Or, founder, pastry chef, and the creative force behind Meraki, started Meraki Bakery fifteen years ago 
                in her home kitchen, selling her creations at the Copley Square farmers market in Boston. 
                For Danielle, building a bakery of her own was about more than just cultivating a thriving business; 
                it was a way to create a sense of home and community while starting a new life as an immigrant to the United States. 
                Her vision for Meraki was humble in origin-grounded in a simple mission to bring people together around 
                great food and pastries while providing a deep sense of comfort and belonging. In missing her home, 
                she would make Meraki a new home for herself and others and leave a powerful and lasting impact by 
                bringing more inspiration, caring, and joy to those needing more of it.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Inspired by Danielle’s legacy and vision, a passionate and diverse team of chefs, pastry chefs, bakers, cooks,
                baristas, and café staff brings Meraki to life in locations throughout Greater Boston and Washington D.C. 
                Even as we grow, our commitment to each other is to own the smallest details, maintain the highest standards,
                and hold fast to our shared mission: To Inspire, Care for, and Nurture life. Every Day.
                <br>
                <br>
                    We are so grateful to the neighborhoods and communities we are a part of and for the incredible support
                of Meraki fans across the country.</p>
